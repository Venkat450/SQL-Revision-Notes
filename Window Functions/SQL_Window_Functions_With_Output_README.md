## üìÑ Sample Table: Employees

| id | name  | department | salary |
|----|-------|------------|--------|
| 1  | Alice | HR         | 5000   |

       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dept_rank
FROM employees;
```

**Expected Output:**

| name  | department | salary | dept_rank |
|-------|------------|--------|-----------|

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ RANK()

**Use case:** Rank employees by salary with gaps in rank for duplicates.

       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
FROM employees;
```

**Expected Output:**

| name  | department | salary | salary_rank |
|-------|------------|--------|-------------|
| Bob   | HR         | 6000   | 1           |

SELECT name, department, salary,
       FIRST_VALUE(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS highest,
       LAST_VALUE(salary) OVER (
         PARTITION BY department 
         ORDER BY salary DESC 
         ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
       ) AS lowest
FROM employees;
```

**Expected Output:**
